# Easy Payment Code Guidelines

## Naming Conventions
1. **Class Names**: Use PascalCase, e.g., `EasyPaymentManager`.
2. **Method Names**: Use camelCase, e.g., `processPayment`.
3. **Variable Names**: Use camelCase, e.g., `paymentAmount`.
4. **Constant Names**: Use uppercase letters with underscores, e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`.

## Code Style
1. **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation.
2. **Line Length**: Limit lines to 80 characters.
3. **Comments**: Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments. Comments should be concise and clear.

## File Organization
1. **Directory Structure**: Organize files by feature modules, e.g., `models`, `services`, `utils`.
2. **File Name**: The file name should use an underscore (_) as a separator, such as `easy_payment_manager.dart`.

## Code Quality
1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class and method should have a single responsibility.
2. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for each feature to ensure code correctness and stability.
3. **Code Review**: Conduct code reviews before merging to ensure code quality.

## Version Control
1. **Commit Messages**: Commit messages should be concise and describe the changes made.
2. **Branch Management**: Use prefixes like `feature`, `bugfix`, `hotfix` for branch names.
